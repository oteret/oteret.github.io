[{"content":"Work done at Google, in collaboration with Eyvind Niklasson and Alexander Mordvintsev.\nMeta learning a learning protocol that can be used instead of SGD, Adam, etc, to train feed-forward neural networks. At least, in theory.\nSee the Arxiv preprint and the code base. The code base contains colabs that show how to use it!\nMy first first author work. Very fundamental in nature and small in scope. Still, it is 9 pages long.\n","description":"Meta-learning a learning rule for feed-forward neural networks that does not use gradients.","id":0,"section":"posts","tags":null,"title":"MPLP: Learning a Message Passing Learning Protocol","uri":"https://oteret.github.io/posts/mplp/"},{"content":"My name is Ettore Randazzo.
